Undergraduate Research Review: Fall 2017

As I think about everything I have looked over these last few months, I feel I am becoming more familiar and comfortable with database commands. The beginning of this semester started with a continuation of what I learned last semester. Previously, I was studying the installation of PostgreSQL on Ubuntu through a command line situation, without a GUI. This semester, the instructions continued off of that. I set up Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine on my own computer, compared to a YSU computer last year. Once the Virtual Machine was set up, Ubuntu was installed and was running smoothly. I did not have it set up very elaborate, as it was only used to install PostgreSQL. Unlike last semester, I also had to install pgAdmin onto Ubuntu as well. 

The goal with using pgAdmin was to have some sort of actual screen and window based on a program that would run PostgreSQL instead of the regular command line. I had to make sure that I was installing the proper items and that they would link with each other correctly. Both programs work with each other, respectively, but I was not familair with how that set up went. I realized it was somewhat similar to how the set up for SQL with the server connection goes on the computers on YSU's campus. Once i was able to figure that out, I familarized myself with pgAdmin and where to actually put the SQL commands at. As I started using it, I became less and less happy with it. I began to dislike the layout and the complexity behind finding certain things. 

By the time I started falling out of love with pgAdmin, my focus shifted. I began to start looking more excessively at logos and different styles of brands for the YSU Data Lab. I was given instructions to come up with a few ideas for different kind of logos. Once I came up with a few logos, we started expanding on the ones we liked, while also looking at different YSU logos to use as well. I ended up creatin a few different kind of logos for the YSU Data Lab, along with two copy logos of a familar YSU logo, but replaced some of the lettering to go with YSU's cloud storage situation. I organized all of the files and creations I made and gifted them over to YSU's Data Lab team for them to use if they would like. They were all created on Adobe Illustrator. 

Overall, I feel I made significant progress in my research for Database studying. I also got to use more of my creative side and design some logos and things for the data lab, which was a lot of fun. I learned a lot this semester and am thankful for everything.

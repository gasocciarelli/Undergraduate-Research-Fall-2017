Instructions to install PostgreSQL

These are some basic commands to input if you would like to install PostgreSQL onto an Ubuntu.

In order to install the program, type the following command:
sudo apt-get install postgresql

There are a few different things people seem to type right after the postgresql part of that command. These additional words in the command line are used for different kind of add-ons or packages. The most common one to add onto the end of that command is:
postgresql-contrib

That addition into the command line will include the proper add-ons for PostgreSQL.

Instructions to install PostgreSQL

These are some basic commands to input if you would like to install PostgreSQL onto an Ubuntu.

In order to install the program, type the following command:
sudo apt-get install postgresql

There are a few different things people seem to type right after the postgresql part of that command. These additional words in the command line are used for different kind of add-ons or packages. The most common one to add onto the end of that command is:
postgresql-contrib

That addition into the command line will include the proper add-ons for PostgreSQL.

In reality, that is about the basic part of actually getting PostgreSQL installed. I will include links that go into more detail about setting up a database under the right user and other things along those lines. While I can provide some information, the actual companies explaining the installation and set-up process cannot be beat. 

Here is the link to instructions through PostgreSQL on how to install the latest version of their product onto Ubuntu:

Here is the link to instructions through Ubuntu on how to install PostgreSQL onto Ubuntu: 
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL

I hope the combination of all of this information will make the installation process a success.
